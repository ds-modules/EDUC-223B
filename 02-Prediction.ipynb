    "# Making Predictions\n",
    "#### Michelle Wilkerson\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lesson is to explore different models and methods for making predictions using data related to gray wolves and Yellowstone National Park. Each model comes with its own pros and cons that need to be considered, and we hope that by the end of this exploration, you will be able to think about possible benefits that come with different methodologies and be more critical of prediction techniques that you encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Yellowstone is a national park located in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, covering almost 3,500 square miles. It became the first National Park in the United States in 1872 under President Ulysses S. Grant. It is thought to not only be the first National Park in the United states, but also the first national park in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=http://d1njyp8tsu122i.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/map-lodging-by-state_680x392.jpg width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "Yellowstone is famous primarily for two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, for its geysers and hot springs. It contains about half of the world’s geysers, with over 450 active geysers. For comparison, the next second largest collection of active geysers has about 200. It is home to the world's tallest active geyser, Steamboat Geyser, and to the famous <a href=\"https://youtu.be/h9uRaEoEV-U?t=1m36s\">Old Faithful Geyser</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The park is also famous for its wildlife. According to the National Park Service, Yellowstone is \"home to the largest concentration of mammals in the lower 48 states,\" with 67 species of mammals, and over 325 different species of birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite being a National Park, the animals of Yellowstone were not originally offered special protections.\n",
    "The <a href=https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/management/yellowstoneprotectionact1872.htm>Yellowstone National Park Protection Act</a> said that the Secretary of the Interior would \"provide against the wanton destruction of the fish and game found within [Yellowstone],\" but made no specific provisions, and left wiggle room for interpretation. Of semi-recent attention has been the status of gray wolves in the park -- which are neither game nor fish, so under the Protection Act, were left on their own. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=http://d1njyp8tsu122i.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Yellowstone-Wildlife-Wolf-11.jpg width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, gray wolves roamed about <a href=\"https://www.nwf.org/Wildlife/Wildlife-Library/Mammals/Gray-Wolf.aspx\">two-thirds</a> of the United States, with numbers estimated to be over a quarter-million, but by the 1960s, the only wild gray wolves in the lower 48 states were restricted to <a href=\"http://www.missionwolf.org/page/wild-wolf-history/\">Michigan and Minnesota</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "With America's westward expansion came the tolling of the bells for wolves. Not only did they have to compete with settlers for space, but they were also hunted. Farmers and ranchers feared for their livestock, and successfully advocated for programs to reduce gray wolf populations. Beginning in the 19th century and continuing into the 20th, there were <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/midwest/wolf/aboutwolves/biologue.htm\">government programs that offered bounties for each wolf killed</a>. In 1880, the superintendent of Yellowstone had stated that <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/the-wolf-that-changed-america-wolf-wars-americas-campaign-to-eradicate-the-wolf/4312/\">\"the value of their [wolves and coyotes] hides and their easy slaughter with strychnine-poisoned carcasses have nearly led to their extermination.”</a> By the end of the 1920s, gray wolves had disappeared from most of the United States. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In 1973, Greater Yellowstone was named as one of three recovery areas for the endangered gray wolf. From 1995 to 1997, 41 wild wolves from Montana and Canada were released in Yellowstone National Park, where their populations have been climbing since. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Wolves in Yellowstone\n",
    "Wolves in Yellowstone primarily feed on hooved animals, the most common being elk, and deer and smaller animals during the summer. When the wolves were reintroduced to the park, of course we would expect some sort of effect on the populations of those animals of prey. In this notebook, we are going to investigate what those effects were on the elk populations, and also on the wolf populations.\n",

    "Before we begin analyzing our data, we need to run some cells of code. You don't need to know what these cells are doing in any detail, for now. To run a cell of code, click on the cell, then type `SHIFT-ENTER` or simply click the button on the toolbar at the top of the page that looks like ▶| .
